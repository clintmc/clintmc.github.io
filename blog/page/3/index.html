FortiManager is capapble of running TCL scripts, which allow for the script to make decisions.
For example, I have a script that will check the name of the FortiGate it is running on, then based on the hostname, it will assign different values to the device. I needed to write this script so I could roll out ADVPN to multiple sites, for a client.

Investigation - HTTPS This site is hosted on GitHub, so going through their documentation it looked like I should have been able to use a CDN and still have GitHub generate a cert for the site. However, it was not.
Solution - HTTPS As an experiment I disabled the CDN, to see if GitHub would be able to generate the certificate - this worked pretty quickly and in the end was pretty simple. I was trying to do something fancy and ended up in a situation where the CDN wasn&rsquo;t really doing everything it could, and neither was GitHub.

Twenty seconds of work, followed by twenty seconds of rest was not much of a stimulus.
The two minutes of rest at the end was enough to nearly fully recover between rounds. Three rounds was sufficient to get my heart rate up, warm up joints and generally get my day started.
Skipping easy didn&rsquo;t go as poorly as I expected - in regards to stepping on the rope - but my calves need to get used to the jumping.

I would squat, either bench or overhead press, deadlift and then do chin ups. Simple, effective, full body and as heavy as I could make it.
My goal for 2020 was to deadlift 555 pounds for a set of 5 reps. I was deadlifting 380 pounds for 5 reps before the gym closed, so I am not likely to hit my goal this year.
This is fine - things happen. 555 pounds was a stretch to begin with.
I had calculated in early January that I needed to add about 4 pounds to my deadlift a week for 40 weeks to hit this goal. But I re-aggivated a shoulder injury and that set me back a bit in February. So with the gym closed - and not having a home gym - I&rsquo;ve got to come up with something else.

Create a new SLA Give it a Name For Protocol pick Ping Add two IPs for servers to run ping tests against - I&rsquo;d recommend 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8, since they are Anycast and globaly respond quickly, but you might want to add one of your ISP&rsquo;s upstream routers. You need to put two addresses in here.

Let&rsquo;s layout some assumptions:
There are server in the office The servers are in either in a well-organized closet or in a server room (they are not in a Colo - but access is restricted) There may be some amount of Cloud/SaaS applications This is not a VDI environment (we could sketch that out in a different post) Security is a concern - but not security at any cost Let&rsquo;s start with what I generally see As a consultant, I&rsquo;ve been engaged by dozens of small/medium size businesses and many large businesses. What I tend to see in the small/medium group is a flat network using a single subnet - a /24 or less common a /16. There is only one VLAN and all the Servers, Switches, Hypervisors and Desktops are in the broadcast domain.
If I was an attacker, this would be a &ldquo;Target Rich Environment&rdquo;&hellip;

More specifically: the hasning function will take an input of variable size and produce an output of a fixed size. The mathmatical process should not be reversible, the same input should always yield a constant output, a small change to the input should have a large change on the output, and two different inputs should never generate the same output.

Here we are going to compare these different components and highlight the cipher suites currently considered strong*.
* currently only means at the time of this writting - a flaw could be found in the algorithm or in the implementation of the algorithm at any time, so do additional research to confirm the current strength of the cipher suite. You&rsquo;ve been warned&hellip;

Each operating system/application will have a set of suites it is capable of supporting.
Let&rsquo;s take a few examples - using the IANA names:
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA Each of these suites has a Protocol, a Key Exchange algorithm, a Signature Authentication algorithm, an Encryption algorithm, and a Message Authentication algorithm.
