    <h2 id="in-the-before-time">In the Before Time</h2>
<p>Before everybody had to stay home all the time, I would be at the local gym 3 days a week working out with barbells. I would squat, either bench or overhead press, deadlift and then do chin ups. Simple, effective, full body and as heavy as I could make it.<br>
My goal for 2020 was to deadlift 555 pounds for a set of 5 reps. I was deadlifting 380 pounds for 5 reps before the gym closed, so I am not likely to hit my goal this year.<br>
This is fine - things happen. 555 pounds was a stretch to begin with.<br>
I had calculated in early January that I needed to add about 4 pounds to my deadlift a week for 40 weeks to hit this goal. But I re-aggivated a shoulder injury and that set me back a bit in February. So with the gym closed - and not having a home gym - I&rsquo;ve got to come up with something else.</p>
<h2 id="first-try">First Try</h2>
<p>I started doing a circuit of 9 movements, each movement for 5 reps - except the last, which was planks, which I would hold for 30 seconds. I would try one or two rounds in the morning and then think about doing another 2 rounds at lunch (which I don&rsquo;t think ever happened) and then maybe do 2 or 3 rounds after work.<br>
I&rsquo;ve got a 45 pound kettlebell and a pair of 20 pound kettlebells and the second or third round in a row would start to get my heart up and get me sweaty.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t working for me. Each movement is too little to do much and the total work of 3 rounds isn&rsquo;t much either.  So this plan has been discarded.</p>
<h2 id="second-try">Second Try</h2>
<p>My new plan, which like all plans is only good until you get punched in the face (to twist up a Mike Tyson quote), is to do a 3 movement circuit, each movement will be done for 20 seconds - with a 20 second break between movements, then rest for 2 minutes before repeating the circuit. Ideally pushing myself for 3 rounds to start.<br>
Unlike the previous plan I&rsquo;m doing this first thing in the morning - then going about my day.<br>
At lunch I&rsquo;m going to skip rope for a few minutes - just skip easy for a for a bit, no set time goal.<br>
I haven&rsquo;t skipped rope for a while, so this is going to suck. My timing will be off and it&rsquo;s really boring to skip easy.</p>
<p>Switching to a time based, instead of rep based plan should allow me to accumulate more work in the specific movements. Alternating working and rest should provide more of a cardio stimulus and then a cardio recovery period. The weights I&rsquo;m moving are small for me - so I don&rsquo;t expect to get completely gassed, but it is certainly possible - especially in the 3rd round.<br>
In the first plan I didn&rsquo;t take a break between circuits, so the only rest was changing positions/changing kettlebells/planks. (Yeah, planks were a rest - they weren&rsquo;t easy, but compared to squatting 340 for 5 reps, well, yeah, they were easy compare to that.)<br>
Skipping at lunch is partially to break up the day and force myself to do something active.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-calorie-intake">Thoughts on Calorie Intake</h2>
<p>Lifting 3 days a week at near max for every set burns a lot of calories* - my body still craves that level of intake and I&rsquo;m having to actively steer myself into eating for my current calorie needs.  Being in the house all day, &rsquo;ery day means fewer calories burned. My understanding of caloric requirements suggest that my Basal Metabolic Rate would account for a large part of my calorie burn - I&rsquo;m a computer guy, not a dietitian - and my basal rate will not have changed much in the last few weeks - so I shouldn&rsquo;t have to actually cut my calories drasticly. However, since I&rsquo;m not lifting and therefore don&rsquo;t need all those extra calories for tissue repair - I should not need to eat as much. But, habits are hard to break and I&rsquo;ve been eating for lifting for a while now, adding the skipping and doing HIIT style exercises should add some additional calorie expenditure. So, in the wash between trying to eat less and doing some exercise I should end up with a minor calorie deficit or minor calorie surplus.</p>
<p>*<em>a lot is relative - I believe it burns &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; compared to running for 30 minutes. I&rsquo;m also factoring in increased muscle mass raising BMR, pushing the caloric burn of lifting higher still. It&rsquo;s a virtuos cycle - I eat to lift, I lift to eat.</em> ;)</p>
<p>What are you doing to stay active and fit?</p>
