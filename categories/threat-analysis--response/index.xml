      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-hidden-security-controls-that-could-have-prevented-canadas-biggest-ransomware-attacks&#34;&gt;The Hidden Security Controls That Could Have Prevented Canada&amp;rsquo;s Biggest Ransomware Attacks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Canadian organizations paid ransom demands 79% of the time when attacked—meaning cybercriminals are successfully monetizing their operations four out of five attempts. For context, that&amp;rsquo;s a higher success rate than most legitimate businesses achieve with their core products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In February of that same year, the City of Hamilton faced every IT leader&amp;rsquo;s nightmare. Despite actively working to improve their cybersecurity posture—including an ongoing multi-factor authentication rollout—attackers found gaps in their defenses and exploited them before the security improvements could be completed. The outcome: $18.3 million in immediate response costs, denied insurance coverage, and budget impacts that will affect taxpayers through 2027.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-risk&#34;&gt;What is the Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The risk is high.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://verizon.com/dbir/&#34;&gt;Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report&lt;/a&gt; lays out the statistics quite clearly. Comparing the three types of attacks - Business Email Compromise (BEC), Computer Data Breach (CDB) &amp;ldquo;Hacking&amp;rdquo; and Ransomware - there were 7 times the number of incidents of BEC. [BEC = 19,000; CDB = 2,780; Ransomware = 2,480]&lt;br&gt;&#xA;While not all incidents ended with the victim losing money, BEC came in number one here again - having the most incidents leading to a loss.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The median loss to a BEC incident, reported by Verizon in 2021, was $30,000 USD. The FBI Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3.gov) reported over $1,800,000,000 USD in losses in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Existential Cash Flow Crisis of Ransomware</title>
      <link>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/existential-cash-flow-crisis-of-ransomware/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has evolved into a model known as Double Extortion. Before encrypting your data and holding it ransom, the criminals copy the data off your computers to their own, where they keep it as a hostage. If you choose to not pay the ransom they will expose the hostage copy of your data publicly on the internet. They use reputation risk and confidentiality requirements (either regulation or contractual) as a way to force the payment. Further, while they have a copy of your data, they are able to read your financials and insurance contracts so that they can set the maximum ransom. While there is a negotiation to determine the ransom, it is very one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
