&lt;p&gt;When municipalities move to Microsoft 365, they often assume that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s compliance certifications mean automatic FOIPPA compliance. This assumption can be costly. The shared responsibility model means that while Microsoft secures the infrastructure, municipalities remain responsible for their data governance, access controls, and compliance obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding where Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities end and yours begin is critical for maintaining FOIPPA compliance in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

M365 defaults: Deleted emails gone forever after 30 days. Your compliance gap: 335 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city&amp;rsquo;s legal counsel calls your office. The development company&amp;rsquo;s lawyer is demanding to know why key emails about the rezoning decision are missing from the FOI response. &amp;ldquo;This looks like deliberate destruction of evidence,&amp;rdquo; they&amp;rsquo;re saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your FOI coordinator explains that staff deleted routine emails months ago, and your IT systems automatically purged them after 30 days. The lawyer isn&amp;rsquo;t buying it. &amp;ldquo;Government records disappearing during a controversial decision? We&amp;rsquo;ll see you in court.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Five Tips to Secure M365 Business Standard</title><link>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/five-tips-to-secure-m365-business-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 21:10:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/five-tips-to-secure-m365-business-standard/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-to-improve-security-in-m365"&gt;How to improve security in M365&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has added a lot of security features to the M365 platform, but not all of them are available to all license levels.
If you are licensed for M365 Business Standard you won&amp;rsquo;t have access to all the security features in the platform, so let&amp;rsquo;s focus on what
is available to your tenant and review the Top 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup multi-factor authentication for all users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create dedicated admin accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter out commonly malicious attachments from email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mail flow rules to warn users about potentially dangerous attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mail flow rules to prevent auto-forwarding of email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-do-these-improve-security"&gt;How do these improve security?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1-multi-factor-authentication"&gt;1. Multi-factor Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users adds an additional layer of security when your users login. Since all M365 is hosted in the cloud,
the only way to verify access is by username and password - unless you also have MFA enabled. Before organizations moved to M365, they would often have a
server in their office, with a firewall protecting the office network from the outside. Limiting who was able to talk to the server. Since M365 is on the
internet, everyone has access. If an attacker can guess your users&amp;rsquo; usernames and passwords then they can get in.&lt;br&gt;
Enabling MFA greatly complicates things for an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
