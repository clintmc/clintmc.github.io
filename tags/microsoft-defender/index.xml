      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-hidden-security-controls-that-could-have-prevented-canadas-biggest-ransomware-attacks&#34;&gt;The Hidden Security Controls That Could Have Prevented Canada&amp;rsquo;s Biggest Ransomware Attacks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Canadian organizations paid ransom demands 79% of the time when attacked—meaning cybercriminals are successfully monetizing their operations four out of five attempts. For context, that&amp;rsquo;s a higher success rate than most legitimate businesses achieve with their core products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In February of that same year, the City of Hamilton faced every IT leader&amp;rsquo;s nightmare. Despite actively working to improve their cybersecurity posture—including an ongoing multi-factor authentication rollout—attackers found gaps in their defenses and exploited them before the security improvements could be completed. The outcome: $18.3 million in immediate response costs, denied insurance coverage, and budget impacts that will affect taxpayers through 2027.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
