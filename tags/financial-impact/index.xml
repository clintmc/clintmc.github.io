Before encrypting your data and holding it ransom, the criminals copy the data off your computers to their own, where they keep it as a hostage. If you choose to not pay the ransom they will expose the hostage copy of your data publicly on the internet. They use reputation risk and confidentiality requirements (either regulation or contractual) as a way to force the payment. Further, while they have a copy of your data, they are able to read your financials and insurance contracts so that they can set the maximum ransom. While there is a negotiation to determine the ransom, it is very one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
