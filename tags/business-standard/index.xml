&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has added a lot of security features to the M365 platform, but not all of them are available to all license levels.
If you are licensed for M365 Business Standard you won&amp;rsquo;t have access to all the security features in the platform, so let&amp;rsquo;s focus on what
is available to your tenant and review the Top 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup multi-factor authentication for all users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create dedicated admin accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter out commonly malicious attachments from email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mail flow rules to warn users about potentially dangerous attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mail flow rules to prevent auto-forwarding of email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-do-these-improve-security"&gt;How do these improve security?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1-multi-factor-authentication"&gt;1. Multi-factor Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users adds an additional layer of security when your users login. Since all M365 is hosted in the cloud,
the only way to verify access is by username and password - unless you also have MFA enabled. Before organizations moved to M365, they would often have a
server in their office, with a firewall protecting the office network from the outside. Limiting who was able to talk to the server. Since M365 is on the
internet, everyone has access. If an attacker can guess your users&amp;rsquo; usernames and passwords then they can get in.&lt;br&gt;
Enabling MFA greatly complicates things for an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
