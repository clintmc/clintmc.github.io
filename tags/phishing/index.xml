&lt;p&gt;The risk is high.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://verizon.com/dbir/"&gt;Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report&lt;/a&gt; lays out the statistics quite clearly. Comparing the three types of attacks - Business Email Compromise (BEC), Computer Data Breach (CDB) &amp;ldquo;Hacking&amp;rdquo; and Ransomware - there were 7 times the number of incidents of BEC. [BEC = 19,000; CDB = 2,780; Ransomware = 2,480]&lt;br&gt;
While not all incidents ended with the victim losing money, BEC came in number one here again - having the most incidents leading to a loss.&lt;br&gt;
The median loss to a BEC incident, reported by Verizon in 2021, was $30,000 USD. The FBI Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3.gov) reported over $1,800,000,000 USD in losses in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
