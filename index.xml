      <title>ADVPN Overview</title>

      <description>High Level Overview To explain ADVPN it is useful to contrast it with the two main alternatives - Hub &amp;amp; Spoke and Full Mesh.
In a Hub &amp;amp; Spoke network one site is deemed the Hub, with all other sites - Spokes - connecting directly to the Hub. In a Full Mesh all sites connect to all other sites.
ADVPN starts as Hub &amp;amp; Spoke, with one site deemed the Hub - but all Spokes can directly connect by getting connection details from the Hub.</description>

      <title>FortiManager VPN Certificate</title>

      <description>Issue FortiManager, when it&amp;rsquo;s new - I think, will sometimes try to push a certificate to FortiGate devices.
The error message in FortiManager is spread across four lines, they are:
&amp;ldquo;Input is not a valid CA certificate.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;The field ca is empty!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;node_check_object fail! for ca&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Attribute &amp;lsquo;ca&amp;rsquo; MUST be set.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve run into this in my lab, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I saw this in a production FortiManager.</description>

      <description>FortiGate Scripts I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of scripting for FortiGates recently. Much of it in TCL.
FortiManager is capapble of running TCL scripts, which allow for the script to make decisions.
For example, I have a script that will check the name of the FortiGate it is running on, then based on the hostname, it will assign different values to the device. I needed to write this script so I could roll out ADVPN to multiple sites, for a client.</description>

      <description>Problems  My site was not available over HTTPS.
 My site was slow to load.
  Investigation - HTTPS This site is hosted on GitHub, so going through their documentation it looked like I should have been able to use a CDN and still have GitHub generate a cert for the site. However, it was not.
Solution - HTTPS As an experiment I disabled the CDN, to see if GitHub would be able to generate the certificate - this worked pretty quickly and in the end was pretty simple.</description>

      <description>Home Lab Build This seems like good time to dust off the home lab gear. So I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the hardware out and made sure everything has downloaded all the updates.
My lab is pretty simple.
The network is a FortiGate, FortiSwitch and FortiAP.
The compute and storage is a desktop that I&amp;rsquo;ve jammed as many SSDs into as I can.
I&amp;rsquo;m running Hyper-V on Windows 10, because it is simple and provides the features I need.</description>

      <title>Training Report - Day 1</title>
      <link>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/training-report-day1/</link>

      <description>How the new plan went The training was executed as planned.
Twenty seconds of work, followed by twenty seconds of rest was not much of a stimulus.
The two minutes of rest at the end was enough to nearly fully recover between rounds. Three rounds was sufficient to get my heart rate up, warm up joints and generally get my day started.
Skipping easy didn&amp;rsquo;t go as poorly as I expected - in regards to stepping on the rope - but my calves need to get used to the jumping.</description>

      <description>In the Before Time Before everybody had to stay home all the time, I would be at the local gym 3 days a week working out with barbells. I would squat, either bench or overhead press, deadlift and then do chin ups. Simple, effective, full body and as heavy as I could make it.
My goal for 2020 was to deadlift 555 pounds for a set of 5 reps. I was deadlifting 380 pounds for 5 reps before the gym closed, so I am not likely to hit my goal this year.</description>

      <description>Purpose How do you design a well-organized, well managed network for small/medium business?
Let&amp;rsquo;s layout some assumptions:
 There are server in the office The servers are in either in a well-organized closet or in a server room (they are not in a Colo - but access is restricted) There may be some amount of Cloud/SaaS applications This is not a VDI environment (we could sketch that out in a different post) Security is a concern - but not security at any cost</description>

      <title>Hashing</title>
      <link>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/hashing/</link>

      <guid>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/hashing/</guid>
      <description>What is Hashing Very simplified: Hashing is a mathmatical operation used to take an Input and turn it into a different Output.
More specifically: the hasning function will take an input of variable size and produce an output of a fixed size. The mathmatical process should not be reversible, the same input should always yield a constant output, a small change to the input should have a large change on the output, and two different inputs should never generate the same output.</description>

      <title>Crypto Cipher Suite Comparison</title>

      <guid>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/crypto-cipher-suite-comparison/</guid>
      <description>Components As detailed in my post on Cryptographic Cipher Suites each of the suites has a Protocol, a Key Exchange algorithm, a Signature Authentication algorithm, an Encryption algorithm, and a Message Authentication algorithm.
Here we are going to compare these different components and highlight the cipher suites currently considered strong*.
* currently only means at the time of this writting - a flaw could be found in the algorithm or in the implementation of the algorithm at any time, so do additional research to confirm the current strength of the cipher suite.</description>

      <guid>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/cryptographic-cipher-suites/</guid>
      <description>What are Cryptographic Cipher Suites Cipher suites are a combination of different algorithms the system will use to encrypt the communication. Each operating system/application will have a set of suites it is capable of supporting.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a few examples - using the IANA names:
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA  Each of these suites has a Protocol, a Key Exchange algorithm, a Signature Authentication algorithm, an Encryption algorithm, and a Message Authentication algorithm.</description>

      <description>How it works with Cloudflare Cloudflare hosts my DNS. It provides me a simple interface for management, 2FA for login and acts as a CDN. So it was an easy choice years ago to move DNS there.
Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about DNS a lot lately I decided to see if I could setup DNSSEC for my own domain.
It took my about 5 minutes.
In Cloudflare - under DNS, hit the button to Setup DNSSEC.</description>

      <description>View from the client A client system - phone, dekstop, laptop, server - looking to find an IP address for a name, lets use www.clintmcguire.com as an example, sends a DNS request to its configured name resolvers.
Name resolvers are either statically assigned by a network administrator or handed out by DHCP.
The client sends a request - typically via UDP - on port 53, to the name resolver. This is a question, asking for the Resource Record (RR) details that match a name/domain name.</description>

      <description>DNS Analogy The analogy typically used to explain what DNS does is to compare it to a Phone Book. Which isn&amp;rsquo;t a great analogy, when you look at how DNS works.
I think I have a better analogy. The downside of my proposed analogy, is that it requires some additional explaining - although I suspect people coming out of school today aren&amp;rsquo;t very familiar with phone books anymore either&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Time in Windows - for Domains In a Windows Domain, the default config is for the PDC to get time from an external time source, the other DCs to get time from the PDC and the domain members to get time for a DC in their Site.
So only the PDC should need to be modified.
The commands to configure the PDC to get time from the NTP Pool servers:</description>

      <title>Find Azure Market Place Image Offers from PowerShell</title>

      <description>Following up on my post about finding Azure Images by Publisher, here is how to get all the SKUs for the specific Offers.
Get-AzVMImageSKu is the command to run.
It requires Location, Publisher, and Offer.
For example: Get-AzVMImageSku -Location &amp;lsquo;eastus&amp;rsquo; -publisher &amp;lsquo;fortinet&amp;rsquo; -Offer &amp;lsquo;fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5&amp;rsquo;
This will return the two SKUs - &amp;ldquo;fortinet_fg-vm&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fortinet_fg-vm_payg&amp;rdquo;
You can take the SKUs and use those to deploy new VMs.</description>

      <description>First install the PowerShell Az Module.
On Windows, open an elevated PowerShell window and run: Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
On MacOS, use sudo to open pwsh, then run: Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
Once the Az module is installed, exit the elevated/sudo PowerShell session and open a regular PowerShell session.
Connect to your Azure account - Connect-AzAccount and use the device login URL and Code to sign in.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact Publisher Name, you can find it by looking at all the Publishers.</description>

      <description>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the file use Get-FileHash to calculate the SAH256 hash. $hash = (Get-FileHash .\filename.exe).hash
Set the copy the hash valie from the website and assign it to a variable to compare.
$webhash = &amp;ldquo;3&amp;hellip;f&amp;rsquo; [Paste the full SHA256 hash in the quotes]
Then use PowerShell to compare this to the published hash.
if ($hash -eq $webhash){$true}
If this returns &amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo; then the hashes match.
Or if you want to do it in one line: If ((Get-FileHash .</description>

      <description>I was looking into an certificate issue a client was having with their web proxy and in testing I thought it might be helpful to resolve the DNS names for all the open connections on ports 80 and 443.
A quick netstat -anop tcp shows too many connections to bother doing manually and scraping the output with PowerShell would be possible, but isn&amp;rsquo;t my first choice.
Thankfully Get-NetTCPConnections will show very similar details to the netstat above, so I started there.</description>

      <description>I have a utility server that I connect to frequently and for some reason or other, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to investigate yet, a certain Citrix related process launches and re-launches. Over the course of weeks there can be 30+ instances of this process running under my user account.
The specific process doesn&amp;rsquo;t take up much CPU or RAM, but it is annoying and if I someone else is using the server for real work, then those resources could be better allocated.</description>

You can access Red Hat Support via the CLI tool redhat-support-tool The tool gives you access to the KB, which you can search from the CLI and you can work with support tickets.
Running sosreport will create an archive file with logs and other info that can be attached to a ticket.
redhat-support-tool has options for attaching files, it will look for an sosreport when you first open the ticket.</description>

      <guid>https://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/use_powershell_to_test_connection_to_a_port/</guid>
      <description>To quickly test if you can communicate with a server on a specific port use this command: Test-NetConnection (hostname/ip) -Port (tcp port number) You are looking for TcpTestSucceeded : True in the output.
Example: PS C:\Users\Clint&amp;gt; Test-NetConnection www.google.com -port 80
ComputerName : www.google.com RemoteAddress : 74.125.28.103 RemotePort : 80 InterfaceAlias : vEthernet (LAN) 2 SourceAddress : 192.168.0.5 TcpTestSucceeded : True
This command is quite flexible, you can also have it test with ICMP like PING and Trace Route.</description>

I wrote a script to get the last time each computer logged into the domain.
This script is very similar to my script that gets user last logon times, which you can find here.</description>
