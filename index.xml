      <title>How DNS Works</title>

      <description>DNS Analogy The analogy typically used to explain what DNS does is to compare it to a Phone Book. Which isn&amp;rsquo;t a great analogy, when you look at how DNS works.
I think I have a better analogy. The downside of my proposed analogy, is that it requires some additional explaining - although I suspect people coming out of school today aren&amp;rsquo;t very familiar with phone books anymore either&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Time in Windows - for Domains In a Windows Domain, the default config is for the PDC to get time from an external time source, the other DCs to get time from the PDC and the domain members to get time for a DC in their Site.
So only the PDC should need to be modified.
The commands to configure the PDC to get time from the NTP Pool servers:</description>

      <title>Find Azure Market Place Image Offers from PowerShell</title>

      <description>Following up on my post about finding Azure Images by Publisher, here is how to get all the SKUs for the specific Offers.
Get-AzVMImageSKu is the command to run.
It requires Location, Publisher, and Offer.
For example: Get-AzVMImageSku -Location &amp;lsquo;eastus&amp;rsquo; -publisher &amp;lsquo;fortinet&amp;rsquo; -Offer &amp;lsquo;fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5&amp;rsquo;
This will return the two SKUs - &amp;ldquo;fortinet_fg-vm&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fortinet_fg-vm_payg&amp;rdquo;
You can take the SKUs and use those to deploy new VMs.</description>

      <description>First install the PowerShell Az Module.
On Windows, open an elevated PowerShell window and run: Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
On MacOS, use sudo to open pwsh, then run: Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
Once the Az module is installed, exit the elevated/sudo PowerShell session and open a regular PowerShell session.
Connect to your Azure account - Connect-AzAccount and use the device login URL and Code to sign in.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact Publisher Name, you can find it by looking at all the Publishers.</description>

      <description>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the file use Get-FileHash to calculate the SAH256 hash. $hash = (Get-FileHash .\filename.exe).hash
Set the copy the hash valie from the website and assign it to a variable to compare.
$webhash = &amp;ldquo;3&amp;hellip;f&amp;rsquo; [Paste the full SHA256 hash in the quotes]
Then use PowerShell to compare this to the published hash.
if ($hash -eq $webhash){$true}
If this returns &amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo; then the hashes match.
Or if you want to do it in one line: If ((Get-FileHash .</description>

      <title>Resolve all Remote Hosts that you are Connected</title>

      <description>I was looking into an certificate issue a client was having with their web proxy and in testing I thought it might be helpful to resolve the DNS names for all the open connections on ports 80 and 443.
A quick netstat -anop tcp shows too many connections to bother doing manually and scraping the output with PowerShell would be possible, but isn&amp;rsquo;t my first choice.
Thankfully Get-NetTCPConnections will show very similar details to the netstat above, so I started there.</description>

      <description>I have a utility server that I connect to frequently and for some reason or other, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to investigate yet, a certain Citrix related process launches and re-launches. Over the course of weeks there can be 30+ instances of this process running under my user account.
The specific process doesn&amp;rsquo;t take up much CPU or RAM, but it is annoying and if I someone else is using the server for real work, then those resources could be better allocated.</description>

      <description>Notes from RHEL 7 Partner Training&amp;hellip;
You can access Red Hat Support via the CLI tool redhat-support-tool The tool gives you access to the KB, which you can search from the CLI and you can work with support tickets.
Running sosreport will create an archive file with logs and other info that can be attached to a ticket.
redhat-support-tool has options for attaching files, it will look for an sosreport when you first open the ticket.</description>

      <title>Use PowerShell to test connection to a port</title>
      <link>http://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/use_powershell_to_test_connection_to_a_port/</link>

      <guid>http://www.clintmcguire.com/blog/use_powershell_to_test_connection_to_a_port/</guid>
      <description>To quickly test if you can communicate with a server on a specific port use this command: Test-NetConnection (hostname/ip) -Port (tcp port number) You are looking for TcpTestSucceeded : True in the output.
Example: PS C:\Users\Clint&amp;gt; Test-NetConnection www.google.com -port 80
ComputerName : www.google.com RemoteAddress : 74.125.28.103 RemotePort : 80 InterfaceAlias : vEthernet (LAN) 2 SourceAddress : 192.168.0.5 TcpTestSucceeded : True
This command is quite flexible, you can also have it test with ICMP like PING and Trace Route.</description>

      <title>Powershell script to get all computers last logon time</title>

      <description>Update I&amp;rsquo;ve posted an updated version of this script in a new section of my blog. Because all the comments below relate to the original version of the script I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave that version posted here. You can find the new version of the script here.
I wrote a script to get the last time each computer logged into the domain.
This script is very similar to my script that gets user last logon times, which you can find here.</description>
